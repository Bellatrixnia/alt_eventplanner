Gemeinde Altrich Eventplanner
=============================

Extension to manage volunteers to help with the events.

In BE data get maintained, such as creating events, and organizing FE users.
There will be no FE users registration, needed records will be created manually in BE.
In frontend, a plugin shows a month wise view of scheduled event, with pagination to move backwards and forward.
If a logged in user clicks on one of the events, a registration form opens with several options. One can be chosen.
The result is reflected in the color schema of the calendar view.
